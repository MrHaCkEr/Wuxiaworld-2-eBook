# Wuxiaworld-2-eBook
This Python script will download chapters from novels availaible on wuxiaworld.com and saves them into the .epub format.

## Getting Started

To run this script you'll need to have Python 3.6.x install which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python Download Link").

### Features

- Download and save you favorite Novels from wuxiaworld.com into a .epub file
- Automatically adds some metadata like author, title and cover

### Prerequisites

As mentioned before this script was written for Python version 3.6.x. It may work with other versions too but none are tested.
Additionally the Python image library (Pillow) is required.
To install all dependencies just use the console to navigate into the project folder and write

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Download the script and navigate to the folder using the console then write

```
python wuxiaworld2ebook.py
```

if you didn't add Python to the PATH variable during the installation or afterwards the write

```
path/where/you/installed/python.exe wuxiaworld2ebook.py
```

After that just look for the novel you want to read, enter the chapter's you want to include to the eBook, enter the book number of the novel you want to read (if applicable) and hit the "Generate" Button. Keep it mind that it will take some time for the script to finish, so don't close the window or the console if the program doesn't respond.
